First semester Java Programming Group Project

This was the final project for my first semester Java programming class.  My Classmates, Andy, Shane and I made a "drum machine" using the EZ.java library provided us.  *** EZ is copyrighted *** read the file before using or reproducing.

We split up the different files amongst ourselves and then collaborated to get this final working version.  Each file has attribution for the parts we each worked on.  This was our first group project together as ICS student at University of Hawaii at Manoa, and we are all still friends after meeting eaother for this goofy project.
